      <li>What is react?What are its features?</li>
      React is craeated by jordane walke,a software enginner at facebook in the
      year 2100 and it was deployed frist at the facebook newsfeed and later it
      was used in facebok and instagram. React is open sourse front and js
      library,created by facebook in 2011.Its follows the component based
      apporoach for building reusable Ui components speacilly for single page
      application and it is uesed for developing interactive view layer of web
      and mobile aaplication.

        <li>Virtual dom</li>
        <li>One way data Binding</li>
        <li>Reuasble Component</li>
        <li>Jsx(javascripted syntex extension)</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <li>Explain Virtual Dom</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Exapin virtual dom</li>
      DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real
      DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application
      gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components
      gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any
      changes on the screen like button click because of which the state
      variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go
      to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we
      are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of
      mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another
      virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state
      variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each
      other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known
      as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real
      dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliatio

    <li>React ,Angular or veu</li>
    library is a set of reusable function used by computer program and freamwork
    is picece of code that dictates the architecher of a project , code calls
    and library but in fremework calls the code. in library we can control the
    data flow bt method but in frameworks calls the code and in performance wise
    react is having higher performance over angular and veu and community
    support and also react is having the easy learing curve and react is having
    the easy larning curve and react is having SPA(Single Page application).
    <li>class vs fun compo</li>
    <li>
      Class component uses the lifecycle methods where as in functonal component
      have hooks
    </li>
    <li>
      Functinal componet are also called stateless component while class
      component is called satefull component and ther is no render function
      while in functonal there is return
    </li>
    <li>
      functonal componets are easty to read as they have less code biu the class
      components have complex code sturcture and hard to write
    </li>
    <li>
      In class component we use "this keyword" but in functonal we did not use
      this keyword
    </li>
    <li>Stateless vs Statefull</li> Stateless component does not hold or manage state While statefu;ll component can hold or manage state, Stateless component are easy to understand but the statefull component it is complex as compared to the stateless components. Stateless component does not work with react lifecycles but whreas statefull work with lifecycle methods. Stateless can not be reused while can be used in case of statefull component.Stateless compnent is also known as functional component. Statefull is known as class component
    <li>What are the different phases of React components lifecycle?</li> In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
    1.	Initial Phase
    2.	Mounting Phase
    3.	Updating Phase
    4.	Unmounting Phase
    Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
